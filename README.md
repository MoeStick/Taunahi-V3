## 🌾 Farming
All the fully automatic scripts that will level up your farming skill and earn you coins. Supports a high amount of both basic and advanced farm designs.

### 🌱 Wart & Crops
Realistic scripts for automating hours of automatic farming with no downtime, working for a great number of various farm designs.

### 🎃 Pumpkin & Melon
Great option for both XP and money.

### 🌵 Cactus
One of the best options for money, consistently high prices.

### 🍫 Cocoa Bean
Also a good choice for money.

### 🍄 Mushroom
The best crop to farm for XP by far.

### 🌾 Sugarcane
Sugarcane is an okay middle ground between XP and money, but easy to get high scores in.

## ⚔️ Combat
Scripts to maximize your combat level, complete quests, and earn lots of money with both beginner and end-game gear.

### 👻 Ghost
One of the most profitable scripts ever, going up to ~45 mil an hour at the best gear, but it needs very expensive gear.

### 💀 Crypt / Rev Slayer
A fully AFK script that endlessly kills Ghouls with an incredibly smooth pathfinder & autowalker. Full failsafes, everything. Includes an option to automatically start/complete quests.

### 🏹 Zealot (Ranged)
A script that uses ranged weapons such as Juju & Precusor Eye to kill zealots at a much higher frequency than melee scripts.

### ⚔️ Zealot (Melee)
A basic (still incredibly smooth) melee script that runs around the dragons nest (or brusier areas) killing Zealots.

### 🧟 Graveyard
Amazing for fresh accounts, simply runs around killing zombies in the graveyard.

## 🌲 Foraging
Get to level 50 in Foraging in just a few days, no joke.

### 🏞️ Park Foraging
Select your foraging area and endlessly autowalk around breaking trees at high speed. Supports rod swapping, autosell, failsafe, everything.

### 🌳 Hub Foraging
Downgraded version of the Park Foraging script, but it's a good start and nice for new accounts.

### 🌴 2x2 Island Foraging
The classic 2x2 island foraging script. Low XP rates but you keep your privacy whilst in your private island.

## 🎣 Fishing
Both a vital skill as well as being a money maker at end-game gear.

### 🐟 Auto-Fishing
Automatic fishing for water, lava, worm, etc. Supports autokilling, auto-selling, anti-afk, etc.

### 🚣 Fishing w Auto-Travel
Whilst the previous script is incredibly powerful, this script allows you to configure autowalking for specific areas in Skyblock so you can fully AFK fishing with failsafes.

## 🛠️ Miscellaneous
Additional useful scripts outside of the large categories above.

### 🧹 Plot Cleaner
Fully AFK plot cleaner, which uses both walking and flying pathfinders to 100% clear each plot quickly for you.

### 👋 Visitors
Greatly increase your profit/hour by completing visitors in between rewarps.

### 🪨 Cobblestone
The first macro you'd use when starting out, earning < 1m/h but only takes 10 mins to setup.

### 🔮 Alchemy
A speedy script that can take you from level 0 → 50 in just a few hours.

### 🎺 Harp
A fully automatic harp script, with no need to set a click delay like other mods.

### 💤 Anti-AFK
With a failsafe, just AFK's in the spot. Useful for minions.

## 🎛️ Mini Scripts / QOL
Secondary scripts or features that are just for some help with a particular task.

### 🧚 Fairy Souls
Directs you to the nearest (undiscovered) fairy soul.

### 🍫 Cocoa Placer
Vertically places cocoa - useful for building cocoa farms.

## 🔑 Crucial Features
If we named every feature and setting we had, this page would be way too long. So here are the most commonly asked for features.

### 👮️ Hydra Anti-Staff
By far the most advanced anti-staff out there. A system created by us called Hydra with the most check detections, hyper-realistic responses, and instant alerts. Simply unmatched.

### 📈 Scripting Sessions
Taunahi has a spectacular unique feature: Sessions. For all scripting sessions, it will keep track of all statistics and events that happen, which you can look over in your dashboard to see total earnings, failsafes,
